# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! While this is primarily a personal repository for tracking course progress, I'm happy to accept improvements that benefit everyone.

The most helpful contributions are:
* Fixing broken links
* Correcting typos or formatting errors
* Adding links to official resources that are missing
* Clarifying instructions in the `README.md` or `setup_guide.md`

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
The easiest way to contribute is to [open an issue](https://github.com/akash-pandey7/GenAI-intensive-course-with-google). Let me know what's broken or unclear, and I'll fix it.
