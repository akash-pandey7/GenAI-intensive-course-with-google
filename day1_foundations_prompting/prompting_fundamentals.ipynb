You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n",

More than just a flavorful addition to our diets, the olive and its oil have woven themselves into the fabric of our economies, cultures, and health practices.

The olive oil industry alone is a multi-billion dollar global market, supporting countless farmers, processors, distributors, and retailers.

Each encounter fueled his adventurous spirit.\n",

This often includes things like the branch name, indicators for uncommitted changes (e.g., a `+` symbol), ahead/behind status relative to the remote repository, and so on.\n",
       "4.  **Colorizes the Prompt:** Uses colors to make the prompt more readable and to highlight important information.\n",
       "5.  **Virtual Environment Support:** Adds support for showing virtual environment information (e.g., for Python virtual environments).\n",
       "6. **Customization:** it also gives you the ability to change themes and create your own themes.\n",
